                    <p>Divisions do little more than isolate us from one another and from the wisdom and beauty that each one of us can share.  This isolation leads to pain, fear, ignorance, and hatred because division does not seek to understand.</p>

                <p>Technology has been both a blessing and a curse â€“ it has both exacerbated and alleviated these divisions.
                What if we could come closer to understanding someone that is unlike us? The walls of division would fall and isolation would relent to connection.</p>
